# Covenant — developer's guide

This is the owner's map of the codebase: what each part does, why it's built that way,
how to demo it, and what to say (and not say) when presenting it. The README sells the
tool to users; this file explains it to *you*.

## The one-paragraph version

MCP servers expose tools; agents consume them. When a server changes a tool — renames an
output field, tightens an input, rescales a value — nothing throws. The agent keeps
calling, reads a field that no longer exists, and confidently reports a wrong answer.
Covenant makes the tool contract **explicit** (`covenant snapshot` → committed
`covenant.lock.json`), **checked** (`covenant check` diffs the live server against the
baseline and classifies every change), and **enforced** (`covenant proxy` quarantines
drifted tools at runtime; the K8s operator does this declaratively for a fleet).

## The intellectual core: the direction principle

If you explain only one thing, explain this. Severity is not "how big is the change" —
it's **which side of the tool the change is on**, because the consumer is an LLM agent
that re-reads tool definitions every run:

- **Input-side changes fail loud.** The server rejects a bad call, or the agent re-reads
  the schema and adapts. Recoverable → **DEGRADED** (warn; fails CI only under `--strict`).
- **Output-side changes fail silent.** The agent reads a value that is gone, retyped, or
  now intermittently `null` — and proceeds confidently. Unrecoverable → **BREAKING**
  (fails CI; quarantined at the proxy).

This inverts REST intuition (where a tightened input is the classic break) and it is the
justification for every row of the rule table in `covenant/diff.py`. The full rationale
lives in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-01-covenant-layer0-contract-core-design.md`.

## Layer map

Dependency-ordered: each layer ships alone and reuses the ones below it. Optional
dependencies are real extras in `pyproject.toml` — the core installs with nothing but
`mcp`, `typer`, `rich`.

### Layer 0 — contract core (`covenant/*.py`)

| File | Job |
|---|---|
| `introspect.py` | Connects to an MCP server (stdio subprocess or streamable-HTTP), lists tools, runs probes. The only file that talks MCP. |
| `contract.py` | Tool → canonical contract record; read/write/parse the lock file. The lock is **deterministic**: sorted keys, no timestamp — re-snapshotting an unchanged server is byte-identical, so the lock diffs cleanly in git. |
| `diff.py` | The classifier. **Pure** — no I/O, takes two contract sets, returns `Change` records with `tier` ∈ breaking/degraded/compatible. Walks nested schemas recursively (`balance.currency`, `items[].sku`), handles type unions/nullability, and deliberately refuses to guess at `$ref`/`allOf`/`oneOf` composition (flags DEGRADED for manual review instead). |
| `report.py` | Renders the drift table (rich) or `--json`, and maps tiers → exit codes. |
| `cli.py` | Typer app: `snapshot`, `check`, `proxy`. Wires config → introspection → diff → report. |
| `config.py` | Parses `covenant.toml` (server target, `[[probes]]`, `[judge]`). |
| `errors.py` | `CovenantError`: every expected failure becomes **one clean line and exit 2** — never a stack trace, never swallowed. |
| `fingerprint.py` | Response → type-shape fingerprint (see Layer 3). |

**Exit codes are the CI contract**: 0 clean, 1 breaking (or degraded under `--strict`),
2 config/connection error. `schema_hash` covers schemas only — a description typo must
not read as an identity change.

### Layer 1 — proxy + quarantine (`covenant/proxy/`)

`server.py` is a FastAPI reverse-proxy that forwards every JSON-RPC exchange
byte-for-byte (SSE passthrough included) — the client cannot tell it's there. A
`tools/call` to a **quarantined** tool is short-circuited with a clean MCP `isError`
result and never forwarded: the agent sees "tool unavailable" instead of hallucinating
around drifted output. `detect.py` re-checks the upstream; `quarantine.py` holds state.

The key design decision: **drift detection is proxy-owned**. `POST /covenant/refresh`
re-reads the baseline from disk (so a re-snapshot or updated ConfigMap takes effect
without a restart), then makes the proxy re-list the upstream *itself*. Enforcement
never depends on the client's `tools/list` timing, because the SDK can list *after*
the call it should have protected.

### Layer 2 — store (`covenant/store/`)

Optional Postgres persistence (`asyncpg`): quarantine survives restarts; calls and drift
events are logged. The invariant to quote: **store writes are best-effort — log and
swallow, never fail the request path**. A firewall must not drop traffic because its own
telemetry hiccuped. `memory.py` is the default in-process implementation, `base.py` the
interface, so the proxy code has one code path.

### Layer 3 — behavioral probes + LLM judge (`fingerprint.py`, `judge/`)

Schema checking can't see a server that *lies* (schema unchanged, body different), and
most real MCP tools declare no `outputSchema` at all. Probes cover both: you commit safe,
read-only example calls in `covenant.toml`; `snapshot` runs them and stores each
response's **fingerprint** — the type shape of what actually came back — plus one sample
response. `check` re-runs the probes and classifies shape drift with the same severity
model, at location `behavior`.

The judge (`--judge`, `[judge]` extra) catches drift a fingerprint can't: same shape,
changed meaning (a balance quietly rescaled dollars→cents). The model name picks the
provider — `claude-*` → Anthropic, `gemini-*` → Gemini.

The invariant to quote: **judge verdicts are advisory — DEGRADED, never BREAKING.** A
probabilistic detector must not trigger quarantine. Shape drift is judged on the
fingerprint alone because values legitimately change between runs.

### Layer 4 — observability (`covenant/proxy/metrics.py`, `deploy/`)

Prometheus metrics at `GET /covenant/metrics`: per-tool call counters (ok/error/blocked),
latency histograms, drift events, a quarantine gauge. `docker compose up -d prometheus
grafana` gives a provisioned dashboard — the quarantine stat flips green→red within one
scrape of a drift.

Two decisions worth naming:
- **One `CollectorRegistry` per app instance**, never the global registry — tests create
  many apps and the global one collides.
- **Label-cardinality guard**: tool labels are clamped to the baseline name set (unknown
  tool names become `"unknown"`), so an attacker calling ten thousand made-up tool names
  can't mint ten thousand Prometheus series.

### Layer 5 — K8s operator + Helm (`covenant/operator/`, `deploy/helm/covenant/`)

Declarative contract conformance: an `MCPContract` CR names a server, a baseline
ConfigMap, and an interval; a kopf operator runs the existing Layer 0/3 check on that
schedule, writes the verdict into `.status` (printer columns: `kubectl get mcpcontracts`
→ RESULT / BREAKING / LAST CHECK), and POSTs the proxy's `/covenant/refresh` so
quarantine follows drift.

Decisions worth naming:
- **Purity split**: `reconcile.py` holds all logic and has **zero kopf/kubernetes
  imports** — the whole layer unit-tests without a cluster (`tests/test_operator.py`).
  `handlers.py` is glue only.
- **In-operator checks, not Jobs** (a deliberate deviation from the original pitch): a
  check takes milliseconds; running it as a Job means log-scraping or per-Job RBAC just
  to get status back. Revisit Jobs when a check becomes long or needs isolation.
- **Per-CR scheduling via due-gating**: kopf's timer interval is fixed at decoration time
  (30s poll); each CR keeps its own `spec.intervalSeconds` enforced by `due()` against
  `status.lastCheckTime`.
- **A failed check is status, not an exception**: unreachable server, malformed
  baseline, or missing ConfigMap key → `status.result: error`, with tier counts zeroed
  so kopf's merge patch can't leave stale numbers behind. The operator never raises
  from the timer and never crash-loops on one bad contract.
- **RBAC is least-privilege**: mcpcontracts (+status) list/watch/get/patch, configmaps
  get, events create. Nothing else.

One Dockerfile serves both roles (proxy and operator); the Helm chart ships CRD + proxy
Deployment/Service + operator Deployment.

## How the pieces talk

```
covenant.toml ──snapshot──▶ covenant.lock.json (committed, deterministic)
                                   │
        ┌──────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────┐
        ▼                          ▼                           ▼
  covenant check (CI)        covenant proxy               K8s operator
  diff + probes + judge      quarantine on drift          same check on a schedule,
  exit 0/1/2                 /covenant/refresh            verdict → CR status,
                             /covenant/metrics            nudges proxy refresh
```

One classifier (`diff.py`), one baseline format (`contract.py`), three enforcement
surfaces (CI, runtime proxy, cluster). That reuse is the architecture argument: higher
layers add *where* the check runs, never *what* the check means.

## Demo script

```bash
# 1. The linter catches a lie in the schema AND the body
covenant check                          # OK, exit 0
COVENANT_DRIFT=1 covenant check         # BREAKING (output + behavior rows), exit 1

# 2. Schema-identical drift — only probes catch it
COVENANT_BEHAVIOR_DRIFT=1 covenant check    # schema clean, behavior BREAKING, exit 1

# 3. Semantic drift — same shape, changed meaning; only the judge catches it
COVENANT_SEMANTIC_DRIFT=1 covenant check --judge --strict   # DEGRADED, exit 1 (strict)

# 4. Runtime containment
covenant proxy --upstream http://localhost:8000/mcp --port 9000
curl -X POST localhost:9000/covenant/refresh   # proxy re-checks, quarantines
curl localhost:9000/covenant/status

# 5. Observability
docker compose up -d prometheus grafana        # dashboard at localhost:3000

# 6. Fleet (needs a cluster + docker build)
helm install covenant deploy/helm/covenant --set proxy.upstream=http://my-server:8000/mcp
kubectl create configmap covenant-baseline --from-file=covenant.lock.json
kubectl apply -f examples/mcpcontract.yaml
kubectl get mcpcontracts -w                    # RESULT flips clean -> breaking
```

CI runs the drift injections against the repo's own example server on every push
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — the project eats its own dog food.

## Verification status — be precise about this

- 129 tests (+3 Postgres-skipped without a DB), `ruff`, strict `mypy` — green locally
  and in CI. Postgres tests run against a real container when `COVENANT_TEST_DB` is set.
- **Cluster-verified end-to-end** (Docker Desktop Kubernetes): image builds and both
  container roles run; `helm lint` clean; `helm install` deploys all 7 objects; the
  operator reconciles a live `MCPContract` through the full lifecycle — clean →
  breaking (BREAKING=2: schema + probe rows) with the proxy quarantining the exact
  tool, then back to clean with the quarantine released. The live run surfaced and
  fixed two integration bugs no unit test could see: kopf needs cluster-scoped
  CRD + namespace list rights at startup, and the MCP SDK's DNS-rebinding guard
  421s `host.docker.internal` unless the demo server allowlists it
  (`COVENANT_ALLOWED_HOSTS`).
- Still not live-exercised: the Grafana dashboard (provisioned, metric names match,
  but nobody has watched the green→red flip on a running stack).

## Honest limitations (know these before someone finds them)

- **Probes are hand-committed, not LLM-generated.** The original pitch (Project.md) had a
  ReAct agent RAG-generating probe suites; what shipped is `[[probes]]` you write
  yourself. Honest framing: committed probes are deterministic and side-effect-safe by
  construction; generated probes are the roadmap.
- **The judge is advisory by design** — it cannot quarantine. This is a feature (no
  probabilistic quarantine), but it means semantic drift alone never blocks anything.
- **Composed schemas (`$ref`/`allOf`/`anyOf`/`oneOf`) are not resolved** — changes there
  flag DEGRADED for manual review. Deliberate: never silently pass what you can't parse.
- **A clean `check` means "no schema/behavior drift on what we probed"**, not "contract
  safe". Coverage is exactly your probe list.
- **No OTel spans** (deferred; Prometheus only). No value-distribution fingerprints —
  shape only, plus the judge at the margins.

## Presenting it — three framings, same system

- **Technical reviewer**: lead with the direction principle and the purity discipline
  (pure `diff.py`, pure `reconcile.py`, deterministic lock). The claim is a working
  severity *theory* for MCP drift plus three enforcement surfaces reusing one classifier
  — not novel algorithms, novel application: OpenAPI-diff/Pact discipline ported to a
  protocol that has none, with an agent-aware twist (input-loud/output-silent).
- **Pitch**: "REST got OpenAPI diffing and contract testing a decade ago; MCP — the way
  every agent gets its tools now — has nothing. Covenant is the contract firewall for
  MCP: it catches the drift before your agents hallucinate around it, and quarantines the
  tool so they fail safe." The wow moment is demo #2: schema identical, body changed,
  caught anyway.
- **Job-portfolio (platform/reliability roles)**: point at the layer table — reverse
  proxy (FastAPI/async), Postgres store, Prometheus/Grafana, kopf operator + CRD + Helm
  with least-privilege RBAC — each an independently shippable increment with its own
  design spec under `docs/superpowers/specs/`.
